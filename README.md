This is a game called Crystal Collector.
1.  A random number is generated.  This is the "point" you need add your score up to, in order to win the game.
2.  Four crystal images each contain a random number.  Click on any of the crystals to add you score up to the exact poing score.
3.  If you go over the point score you lose.
4.  If you match the point score you win.
5.  After a win or a loss the point score will change as will the crystal images.

This game is good to waste time when you have some free time!
